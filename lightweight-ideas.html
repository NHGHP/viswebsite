              <img src="project.jpg" height="300" alt ="This is an image of my project for VIS Junior Seminar">
              <ol>
                  <li>Start Creating -- It doesn't have to look perfect</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>For the above project, I started drawing patterns on small glass titles using Sharpies </li>
                          <li>I then repeated the process with different mediums, such as flourescent paint </li>
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                  <li>Evaluate your progress and start adding contraints</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>I wasn't a fan of the more hands on approach I was taking </li>
                          <li>Constraint #1: Must be done digitally using Illustrator</li>
                          <li>Constraint #2: Elements of the project must largely be composed from earlier work, or from lab work -- infuse parts of yourself into your design</li>
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                  <li>Continue Creating</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Started making these images on Illustrator </li>
                          <li>Separated the Illustrator file into different layers to compose a book made of clear pages</li>

              <img src="dei.jpg" height="500" alt ="This is an image of the DEI report infographic I designed for the Daily Princetonian">
              <ol>
                  <li>Think of the overall message of the work</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Is it more serious in tone? Is it light-hearted?</li>
                          <li>This piece had a more serious message, so I used clean, readible sans-serif and serif fonts </li>
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                  <li>Consider how many sections there are</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>If there are multiple sections, consider differentiating them by using different fonts that work together </li>
                          <li>For example, here I combined a bold serif font with sans-serif for the body text</li>
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                  <li>Consider if the font family you choose has different weights</li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>The more weights, the better! Instead of using multiple fonts, you can use one font and differentiate the sections by weight</li>
                          <li>For example, use the bold version for the header, and medium or normal version for the body text</li>
                      </ul>
              </ol>
